## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
* **Frontend**: React (v19), Vite (v8)
* **Styling**: Custom CSS Design System (Custom layout structure, transition handlers, responsive CSS variables)
* **Backend / Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL), Row-Level Security (RLS) policies
* **Integration**: Web3Forms API (automated email dispatcher), Lucide Icons

## 📄 Ready-To-Use Resume Bullet Points

### Option 1: Full-Stack / Integration-Focused
* **Developed and deployed** a high-converting, responsive Typeform clone using **React**, **Vite**, and **Supabase**, serving as the lead-generation funnel for a trading mentorship program.
* **Integrated Supabase PostgreSQL** database with secure **Row-Level Security (RLS)** rules, ensuring compliant data ingestion while maintaining a public-facing API endpoint.
* **Architected an asynchronous notification pipeline** using the **Web3Forms API** that delivers real-time email alerts for new leads in the background without affecting frontend application latency.
* **Built a custom, keyboard-accessible autocomplete dropdown** component featuring real-time client-side search, index-based arrow navigation, and a fallback mechanism to capture custom user-defined text.

### Option 2: Frontend / UX-Focused
* **Designed a multi-modal user navigation system** supporting debounced trackpad scroll wheel triggers, window keydown listener shortcuts, and interactive tactile floating navigation controls.
* **Optimized user input experiences** by writing custom UI controls, including letter-keyed choice inputs, a custom fuzzy-search dropdown, and a auto-expanding textarea that adjusts dynamically using DOM scroll-height variables.
* **Created a dynamic completion indicator** and progress bar component that tracks form completion states to maximize UX and application conversion rates.
* **Implemented robust system stability** by wrapping the React application tree in an **Error Boundary** handler and building design-system load states to manage asynchronous backend operations gracefully.

## ⚙️ Core Technical Features & Implementations

### 1. Interactive Form Flow & State Machine
* **Single-Page Section Manager**: Utilizes dynamic CSS transitions to transition active, previous, and next states for a 9-step application form.
* **Progress Tracking**: Features a dynamic progress indicator computing active index position against total questions: `(activeIndex + 1) / totalQ * 100`.
* **Error Resilience**: Uses a custom React `ErrorBoundary` component wrapper to intercept UI anomalies and display clean error summaries without crashing the page.

### 2. Custom Input Component Suite
To deliver a high-quality user experience similar to Typeform, standard HTML inputs were replaced with custom interactive React components:
* **Fuzzy-Search Autocomplete Dropdown**:
  * Implements dynamic filters based on user text queries.
  * Allows arrow key navigation (`ArrowDown`/`ArrowUp`) and choice selection with `Enter`.
  * Automatically shifts focus to search inputs upon question entry using deferred timeouts (`setTimeout` inside `useEffect`).
  * Supports custom option submissions if the desired item is not pre-populated.
* **Auto-Expanding Long Text Input**:
  * Calculates `scrollHeight` in real-time to adjust element height dynamically, preventing scrollbars in input areas.
  * Supports submission on `Enter` and linebreaks on `Shift + Enter`.
* **Hotkeyed Choice Items**:
  * Maps choice lists to alphabetical keyboard badges (A, B, C, etc.) with custom selection visual states.
* **Contact Group Form**:
  * Bundles multiple inputs (First Name, Last Name, Email, and Phone Number) into a single state payload, reducing database round-trips.

### 3. Navigation Layer
* **Debounced Mouse/Trackpad Listener**: Intercepts `wheel` events, checks delta magnitudes, and limits page transitions using a custom delay window (1200ms) to ensure smooth UX.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Detects global keyboard commands (`ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown`) while verifying the user is not actively typing in input fields (`HTMLInputElement`/`HTMLTextAreaElement`).

### 4. Database Schema & Security
* **Supabase Client Wrapper**:
  * Detects presence of environmental credentials (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) and defaults to local console simulation if undefined to support a developer-friendly playground.
* **PostgreSQL Schema (`create_table.sql`)**:
  * Structured table schema recording specific trading data points, geographical locations, and contact records.
  * Explicit indexes applied (`idx_form_submissions_created_at` on `created_at DESC`) to speed up administrative sorting.
* **Row Level Security (RLS)**:
  * Restricts table permissions strictly by database role.
  * Employs an `anon` insert policy (`allow_anon_insert`) for public application submissions.
